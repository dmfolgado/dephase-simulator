Simulate the temporal desynchronization between time series

# TODO
- [x] Implement a method to convert the temporal transformation into the sample domain. The offset still needs some improvements. 
- [ ] Return groundtruth parameters to implement a transformation to convert from unsync to sync vectors
- [ ] Current version is only working with two time series. Implement a version that handles N time series.
